        <!-- Farming Overview -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Farming Around the World</h2>
            <p>Agriculture plays a vital role in the global economy, providing food, raw materials, and employment for billions of people. As the global population continues to grow, sustainable farming methods are more important than ever. In this section, we explore the worldwide agricultural landscape, including production statistics, trends, and sustainable practices.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Global Farming Statistics -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Global Farming Statistics</h2>
            <p>As of the latest reports, over 38% of the worldâ€™s land area is used for agricultural purposes. China, India, and the United States are the leading agricultural producers. However, Africa has the highest growth rate in terms of agricultural land expansion. The following chart shows the distribution of global agricultural land:</p>

        <!-- Sustainable Farming Methods -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Sustainable Farming Around the World</h2>
            <p>Sustainable farming practices are designed to meet current food and textile needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. These methods include organic farming, permaculture, agroforestry, and conservation tillage. Countries such as Costa Rica and Sweden have adopted progressive policies to promote sustainable agriculture practices. The use of crop rotation, integrated pest management, and water-saving irrigation techniques are becoming more common across the globe.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Organic Farming -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Organic Farming - A Global Movement</h2>
            <p>Organic farming is gaining momentum globally due to the rising concerns over synthetic pesticide use and the negative environmental impact of conventional farming. Countries like France, Germany, and the United States have witnessed significant growth in organic farming acreage. The global organic food market size was valued at USD 200 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% from 2024 to 2030.</p>

        <!-- Challenges in Worldwide Farming -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Challenges in Global Agriculture</h2>
            <p>Despite the advancements in farming practices, the global agricultural industry faces several challenges that hinder its growth and sustainability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Unpredictable weather patterns and extreme events like floods, droughts, and wildfires are damaging crop yields worldwide.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Scarcity:</strong> Access to fresh water is becoming more limited, affecting irrigation systems in many parts of the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Degradation:</strong> Unsustainable farming practices are leading to soil erosion and loss of soil fertility, which directly impacts crop production.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Technological Innovations -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Technological Innovations in Farming</h2>
            <p>Advancements in technology are transforming global farming practices. Drones, artificial intelligence, and precision farming are now being used to increase efficiency and reduce costs. For example, AI-powered systems are helping farmers predict crop yields, identify diseases, and optimize irrigation. In addition, advancements in biotechnology have led to genetically modified (GM) crops that are more resistant to pests, diseases, and extreme weather conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Future of Global Farming -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Future of Global Farming</h2>
            <p>The future of farming will see increased focus on sustainable and precision farming methods. As populations rise and demand for food grows, it is crucial to balance agricultural production with environmental preservation. Technological innovations, such as vertical farming and lab-grown meat, are poised to revolutionize the agriculture industry. Governments, NGOs, and private sector organizations must collaborate to ensure food security and sustainability for all.</p>
