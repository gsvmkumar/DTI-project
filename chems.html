    <div class="container">
        <h1>Effects of Chemical Use in Agriculture</h1>

        <!-- Effects on Agricultural Fields Section -->
        <div class="section" id="field-effects">
            <h2>1. Effects on Agricultural Fields</h2>
            <p>Excessive use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides can lead to soil degradation. Over time, these chemicals deplete essential nutrients, reduce soil fertility, and harm beneficial organisms such as earthworms and soil bacteria, which are vital for healthy soil. The continuous use of chemicals can lead to soil compaction, reduced water retention, and increased salinity, making fields less productive and less sustainable in the long term.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Effects on Farm Products Section -->
        <div class="section" id="product-effects">
            <h2>2. Effects on Farm Products</h2>
            <p>Farm products grown with chemical fertilizers and pesticides may contain residues that can accumulate in the produce. These residues can impact the taste, texture, and nutritional quality of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Additionally, some pesticides can alter the natural growth process of plants, affecting the quality and safety of the final product that reaches the consumer.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Health Risks from Chemical Consumption Section -->
        <div class="section" id="health-risks">
            <h2>3. Health Risks of Consuming Chemical-Treated Products</h2>
            <p>Consuming products with chemical residues poses potential health risks. Prolonged exposure to pesticides and herbicides has been linked to a range of health issues, including respiratory problems, hormonal imbalances, and an increased risk of certain cancers. Children and pregnant women are especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of these chemicals. By consuming organically grown or minimally processed foods, individuals can reduce their exposure to these harmful substances.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Soil Contamination Section -->
        <div class="section" id="soil-contamination">
            <h2>4. Soil Contamination</h2>
            <p>Chemicals can leach into the soil, affecting its structure, fertility, and overall health. This contamination can make it difficult for plants to grow and thrive in the affected area.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Water Pollution Section -->
        <div class="section" id="water-pollution">
            <h2>5. Water Pollution</h2>
            <p>Runoff from chemical applications can contaminate nearby water sources, including rivers, lakes, and groundwater. This can harm aquatic ecosystems and make water unsafe for human consumption.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Weed Resistance Section -->
        <div class="section" id="weed-resistance">
            <h2>6. Weed Resistance</h2>
            <p>Overuse of herbicides can lead to the development of “superweeds” that are resistant to these chemicals, making it harder for farmers to control weeds effectively.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Pesticide Residue Section -->
        <div class="section" id="pesticide-residue">
            <h2>7. Pesticide Residue</h2>
            <p>Chemicals can remain in the soil and crops, potentially affecting human health and the environment. These residues can accumulate over time, posing long-term risks.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Soil Erosion Section -->
        <div class="section" id="soil-erosion">
            <h2>8. Soil Erosion</h2>
            <p>Chemical applications can alter soil structure, making it more susceptible to erosion. This can lead to loss of topsoil and reduced agricultural productivity.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Microbial Imbalance Section -->
        <div class="section" id="microbial-imbalance">
            <h2>9. Microbial Imbalance</h2>
            <p>Chemicals can disrupt the balance of beneficial microorganisms in the soil, affecting soil health and fertility. This can impact the long-term sustainability of agriculture.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Nematode Resistance Section -->
        <div class="section" id="nematode-resistance">
            <h2>10. Nematode Resistance</h2>
            <p>Overuse of nematicides can lead to the development of nematode-resistant pests, making it more challenging to manage these soil-borne organisms.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Insecticide Resistance Section -->
        <div class="section" id="insecticide-resistance">
            <h2>11. Insecticide Resistance</h2>
            <p>Overuse of insecticides can lead to the development of insecticide-resistant pests. This can result in increased crop damage and reduced yields.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fungicide-Resistant Diseases Section -->
        <div class="section" id="fungicide-resistance">
            <h2>12. Fungicide-Resistant Diseases</h2>
            <p>Overuse of fungicides can lead to the development of fungicide-resistant diseases. These diseases can spread rapidly and cause significant crop losses.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Soil Compaction Section -->
        <div class="section" id="soil-compaction">
            <h2>13. Soil Compaction</h2>
            <p>Chemical applications can compact the soil, reducing its porosity and aeration. This can hinder root growth and water infiltration, affecting plant health.</p>
