            <h2>Why Farming is Crucial in India</h2>
            <p>Farming is the backbone of Indiaâ€™s economy, employing more than 50% of the Indian workforce. India is the world's second-largest producer of rice, wheat, and many other crops. The agricultural sector contributes to nearly 18% of India's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and is a vital source of livelihood for rural populations. Furthermore, farming is a key element in ensuring food security, reducing poverty, and promoting economic growth.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What is Organic Farming?</h2>
            <p>Organic farming is a method of farming that avoids the use of synthetic chemicals, pesticides, and fertilizers. Instead, it emphasizes the use of natural substances and processes, such as composting, crop rotation, and biological pest control. In India, organic farming has seen a significant rise due to increased awareness of the harmful effects of chemicals on health and the environment.</p>
